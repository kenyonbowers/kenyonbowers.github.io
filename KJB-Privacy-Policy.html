            <h1>Privacy Policy for the King James Bible Discord Bot</h1>

            <p>Effective Date: 7/23/2023</p>

            <p>Thank you for using the King James Bible Discord Bot (referred to as “Bot”). This Privacy Policy outlines how the Bot collects, uses, and protects the information it gathers from users and servers on the Discord platform. By using the Bot, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Information Collected and Usage:</p>

                    <p>1.1 Server IDs and Channel IDs: The Bot collects and stores server IDs and a single channel ID from each server it is a member of. This information is used solely to provide the Bot’s services and functionalities to the server’s users. Server IDs and channel IDs are not linked to any specific individual or personal information.</p>

                    <p>1.2 Message Processing: The Bot processes messages sent within the server to check for Bible verse references. However, it's important to note that the Bot does not store the content of the messages or any personal data related to users. The message processing is done in real-time, and no data is retained or stored beyond the duration of the processing.</p>

                    <p>1.3 Book Version Preference: The Bot allows server owners/administrators to change the accessibility of the Bible version for their servers. The option to choose to only use the 1762 King James Version (KJV) or all other versions is solely for the purpose of customizing the server’s experience.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Data Security:</p>

                    <p>2.1 Data Access: The Bot’s developers, administrators, and affiliated parties will have access to the collected server and channel IDs to maintain and improve the Bot’s performance. However, they will not have access to any personal information or user data beyond the server IDs and channel IDs.</p>

                    <p>2.2 Data Storage: The collected server IDs and channel IDs are securely stored on the Bot’s servers and databases. All reasonable measures are taken to prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of this information.</p>
