								<li>
									<h3 class="belief-resource-title">The Bible</h3>
									<p>I believe the King James Bible is the one and only perfect and infallible Word of
										God in the English language. I believe you never need to touch the Greek/Hebrew
										to understand exactly what God is saying in His Word.</p>
									<p><b>Psalms 12:6</b> - The words of the LORD <i>are</i> pure words: <i>as</i>
										silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3 class="belief-resource-title">The Trinity</h3>
									<p>I believe that God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy
										Spirit/Ghost are One. I am a classical Trinitarian.</p>
									<p><b>1 John 5:7</b> - For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father,
										the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3 class="belief-resource-title">Hell</h3>
									<p>I believe Hell is a real place that was created for Satan and his angels. Because
										of <b>our</b> sin, we are at enmity with God and we can't pay our sin debt on
										our own. Because of this, we will eternally be seperated from Him in Hell, if we
										don't get saved.</p>
									<p><b>Revelation 21:8</b> - But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable,
										and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars,
										shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which
										is the second death.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3 class="belief-resource-title">Salvation is a One-Time Thing</h3>
									<p>I believe once a person is saved, they are forever sealed in Jesus' hand. No one
										(including themselves) can make them lose their salvation.</p>
									<p><b>John 10:28</b> - And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never
										perish, neither shall any <i>man</i> pluck them out of my hand.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3 class="belief-resource-title">Salvation is by Grace Through Faith</h3>
									<p>I believe salvation is, and always has been, by grace through faith. Works cannot
										save you, we cannot be "good enough" to get to Heaven. We need Jesus' blood
										applied to our account.</p>
									<p><b>Ephesians 2:8-9</b> - <b>[8]</b> For by grace are ye saved through faith; and
										that not of yourselves: <i>it is</i> the gift of God: <b>[9]</b> Not of works,
										lest any man should boast.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3 class="belief-resource-title">Pre-Tribulation Rapture</h3>
									<p>I believe that the rapture of the Church will be before the tribulation. The
										Church will not be present during the tribulation but people can still be saved
										during it.</p>
									<p><b>1 Thessalonians 1:10</b> - And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised
										from the dead, <i>even</i> Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3 class="belief-resource-title">Local Church Autonomy</h3>
									<p>I believe in local, New Testament church autonomy. No organization is to be over
										the local church, and it should govern itself. The pastor has the responsibility
										as the overseer, or under shepherd, of the flock, known as the local church.</p>
									<p><b>1 Timothy 3:5</b> - (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how
										shall he take care of the church of God?)</p>
