On joining a server, the bot collects:
- the server id
- the channel from which the bot can freely send messages (for changelogs)

When using the /allowversions or /setchangelogchannel commands, the bot will collect either:
- whether more than just the 1762 King James Bible is allowed
or
- the id of the new changelog channel

On removal from server, the bot will delete all data collected on said server.
