1) What data do we collect?
	a) We collect the server ID, and a single channel ID in each server the bot is in.
	b) We also allow for the ability for administrators of a server to change the channel ID that we store as well as if they want the ability to send Bible verses from only the 1762 King James Bible or not.
2) How do you use the data?
	a) We need the data to insure that servers only have access to the King James Bible and/or which channel they would like to recieve changelogs in.
3) Who do we share collected data with?
	a) We do not share collected data with anyone. Only the owner and bot have access to stored data.
4) How can users contact us with concerns?
	a) Users can contact us through this email: itskenyon@crosscrusaders.com, or through Discord at @kenyonbowers.
5) If you store data, how can users have that data removed?
	a) Once the bot is removed from a server, it will delete all data associated to that server.
