1. Information Collected and Usage:

	1.1 Server IDs and Channel IDs: The Bot collects and stores server IDs and a single channel ID from each server it is a member of. This information is used solely to provide the Bot's services and functionalities to the server's users. Server IDs and channel IDs are not linked to any specific individual or personal information.

	1.2 Book Version Preference: The Bot allows server owners/administrators to change the accessibility of the Bible version for their servers. The option to choose to only use the 1762 King James Version (KJV) or all other versions is solely for the purpose of customizing the server's experience.

2. Data Security:

	2.1 Data Access: The Bot's developers, administrators, and affiliated parties will have access to the collected server and channel IDs to maintain and improve the Bot's performance. However, they will not have access to any personal information or user data beyond the server IDs and channel IDs.

	2.2 Data Storage: The collected server IDs and channel IDs are securely stored on the Bot's servers and databases. All reasonable measures are taken to prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of this information.
