										<h3 class="belief-resource-title">What is "Unconditional Election"?</h3>
										<p>Unconditional Election is the U in TULIP. It is the belief that since the foundations (beginning) of the world, God has predestinated some to be saved, and some to not be saved. Man cannot change these lists. So even if you wanted to get saved, if you aren't on the "elected list," you can't. Only the elect will come to Christ. Those who are not elected, they will all go to Hell.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3 class="belief-resource-title">What does Unconditional Election teach about babies that die?</h3>
										<p>There is a section of people who hold to Unconditional Election who believe that when a baby, or anyone under the age of accountability, dies, if they are an “elect baby” they will go to Heaven, while all “non-elect babies” go to Hell. Now, this belief itself contradicts Unconditional Election, because if God has a list of who will get saved, then they have no option but to eventually receive Christ. A baby that dies cannot do that. A baby <b><i>cannot</i></b> believe on Christ. So according to the logic of the Unconditional Election position, all babies who die will go to Hell.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3 class="belief-resource-title">Setting the stage</h3>
										<p>Now, I would like to bring up a passage:<p>
										<p class="indent"><b>2 Samuel 12:13-23</b> - "<b>[13]</b> And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the Lᴏʀᴅ. And Nathan said unto David, The Lᴏʀᴅ also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. <b>[14]</b> Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the Lᴏʀᴅ to blaspheme, the child also <i>that is</i> born unto thee shall surely die. <b>[15]</b> And Nathan departed unto his house. And the Lᴏʀᴅ struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick. <b>[16]</b> David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth. <b>[17]</b> And the elders of his house arose, <i>and went</i> to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them. <b>[18]</b> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead? <b>[19]</b> But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead. <b>[20]</b> Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed <i>himself,</i> and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the Lᴏʀᴅ, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat. <b>[21]</b> Then said his servants unto him, What thing <i>is</i> this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, <i>while it was</i> alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread. <b>[22]</b> And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell <i>whether</i> GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live? <b>[23]</b> But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me."</p>
										<p>This passage, as we all know, is after David committed adultery with Bathsheba, which resulted in a man child being conceived and born. Because of what David did, God made the baby sick. For the next week, David fasts and prays for God to spare the life of the child, until the baby ends up dying. After the baby's death, we see that David gets up and cleans himself up. His servants find this peculiar, so they ask him:</p>
                                        <p class="indent"><b>2 Samuel 12:21</b> - "Then said his servants unto him, What thing <i>is</i> this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, <i>while it was</i> alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread"</p>
                                        <p>David's response is what I want to focus on, in verses 22 and 23, this is David's answer:</p>
                                        <p class="indent"><b>2 Samuel 12:22-23</b> - "<b>[22]</b> And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell <i>whether</i> GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live? <b>[23]</b> But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me."</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3 class="belief-resource-title">What can we get from this passage?</h3>
										<p>David realized that there was absolutely nothing he could do, for the child was now dead. He said, "can I bring him back again?" (v23). We then see a very comforting statement, "I shall go to him" (v23). This one statement has helped many families throughout time. From losing a young toddler to having a miscarriage, God's Word can comfort. They can find comfort in the fact that they will one day see their child again in Heaven.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3 class="belief-resource-title">What does the Unconditional Election position get wrong?</h3>
										<p>Now, as we established before, if we follow the logic of Unconditional Election, babies cannot go to Heaven. So either one of two things. Either:</p>
                                        <p class="indent">1. God made an exception to the rule and let this baby into Heaven</p>
                                        <p class="indent">2. God sent David to Hell</p>
                                        <p>Let's look at the logical conclusions to both of these. First, if God made an exception, then the whole point of Him electing people was useless. It all just falls apart at that point. If God will make an exception, who else did He make one for? Plus, most that believe in Unconditional Election also believe in what's called "Limited Atonement." Limited Atonement teaches that God only paid for the sins of the elect, so how would God even be able to make an exception if there is only enough blood for the elect? He would run out! I guess one of the elect people won't actually make it to Heaven?</p>
                                        <p>Secondly, if God send David to Hell, then David wasn't part of the elect. Must've sucked to be him. You live life, have the Holy Ghost dwelling in you, you are called a man after God's own heart (<b>1 Samuel 13:14</b>), and yet you still wound up in Hell!</p>
                                        <p>Such a random story, I know. But I do think all Scripture is useful and hopefully I showed you how Unconditional Election, while unbiblical, also contradicts the Bible in more ways than not!</p>
