          Many Christians don’t know how to use Christian liberty correctly. They act as if this liberty lets them do whatever they want to do because “they are not under sin anymore”. However, this is the opposite of what the Bible says about Christian liberty. And when you try and correct and reprove them, they always hit you with a “that’s just your personal conviction”. So what is a personal conviction? What is true Christian liberty?
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="font-bold">Personal Conviction</span> – The conviction of a person to help them stay from sin.
          <br>
          A personal conviction is something God pricks someone’s heart about that isn’t in the Bible but can help keep that individual from sin. So to say that watching movies/TV shows (including sports) with inappropriate clothing, drunkenness, LGBTQ+, and many other things is wrong doesn’t make it a personal conviction. This is because God has commanded us to stay away from those things. Something that someone has a personal conviction about is not sinful. But instead helps them stay on the right path.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="font-bold">Christian Liberty</span> – The freedom a Christian has.
          Now that brings us to Christian liberty. Because we have liberty in Jesus, that means we are no longer the servants of sin. <span class="font-bold">Galatians 5:1</span> - <span class="text-blue-500">Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</span> So according to this verse, we can see that we have liberty in Christ. However, if we look at <span class="font-bold">Romans 6:1-2</span> - [1] <span class="text-blue-500">What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</span> [2] <span class="text-blue-500">God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</span> From these verses, we can clearly see that just because we are saved and have liberty, we are not to use this liberty to sin. <span class="font-bold">Galatians 5:13</span> - <span class="text-blue-500">For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</span> From this verse, we see another spot in the Bible where we are told not to use our Christian liberty for sin. <span class="font-bold">1 Corinthians 6:12</span> - <span class="text-blue-500">All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</span> So Paul here is saying, "hey, I have the liberty to do what I will, but they are not good nor do they further the kingdom of Heaven”. We can also look at <span class="font-bold">1 Corinthians 8:9</span> - <span class="text-blue-500">But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.</span> This verse is telling us that if what you are doing would cause another Christian to fall, then don’t do it. And if we look a little lower in the passage, in verse <span class="font-bold">12</span> - <span class="text-blue-500">But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.</span> The Bible says laying a stumbling block is a sin. So from these verses, we can see that Christian liberty does not:
          <br>
          -   Give you a license to sin
          <br>
          -   Allow you to cause a brother to stumble
          <br>
          Yet, these things I listed above are exactly what Christians are doing and they forget the scriptures. Either that or they want to do what they want to do more than care about what the Bible says.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="font-bold">Commands</span> – Things God has told us to do/stay away from.
          <br>
          Commands of God are things God has told us to do. And we as Christians are to strive to follow all of God’s commands for us. And this goes hand in hand with the last two paragraphs. Because God’s commands are what we are to follow, many Christians use Christian liberty to try and not follow God’s commands. They pick and choose which commands they want to follow which is against what God would have us do. We should listen to any and every command God has given us in his Word.
