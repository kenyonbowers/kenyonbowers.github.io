            <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium my-2 uppercase text-[#89837c]">Why do you need salvation?</h2>
            <p class="text-md">Why exactly does one need to be saved? Well, the Bible tells us that we are all sinners:
            </p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;" (<b>Romans 3:23</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">We have all done things wrong. Maybe you have told a lie or maybe you've stolen something
                (even if it was small like a piece of candy). The Bible, God's Word, tells us that those things are
                sins. Sins seperate us from the love of God and brings death:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"For the wages of sin <i>is</i> death..." (<b>Romans 6:23</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">You may say, "Well, I'm pretty good. I give to charity, I don't cheat people, I am a
                moral person. So, why do I need salvation? I am good enough." But the Bible says:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"...and all our righteousnesses <i>are</i> as filthy rags..." (<b>Isaiah 64:6</b>)
            </p>
            <p class="text-md">Even at our best, we still fall short of the ultimate measuring stick, God's Word. If you
                have realized
                your need for a Saviour, then please continue reading.</p>

        <!-- What sin does -->

            <br>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium my-2 uppercase text-[#89837c]">What sin does</h2>
            <p class="text-md">As I mentioned in the last section:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"For the wages of sin <i>is</i> death..." (<b>Romans 6:23</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">Because of our sin, we will die. Not only will we have a physical death some day, but
                because of our sin, we have a spiritual death as well. We read:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in
                the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." (<b>Genesis 2:17</b>)</p>
            <p>We all know the story, God told Adam and Eve to not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,
                and gave a consequence if they did. This consequence was death. Adam and Eve disobeyed God and ate of
                this tree. But they didn't die. But God said they would! He even said in the very day they ate of the
                tree, they would die! So what happened? Well, they did die that day. No, not physically, but they died a
                spiritual death. The same happens to us as well, because we sin.</p>
            <p>Now, as we have discussed, sin seperates us from God's love. And because of this, when we die
                (physically), we will spend eternity seperated from His love in a place called Hell.

        <!-- What is Hell? -->
        <section class="xl:mx-96 lg:mx-52 md:mx-10 mb-6 flex flex-col text-left justify-center gap-2">
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium my-2 uppercase text-[#89837c]">What is Hell?</h2>
            <p class="text-md">Hell is the place that the lost (those in need of salvation) will spend the rest
                of eternity in. But what is Hell like? I mean, it can't be <i>that</i> bad,
                right? Well, let's see what Jesus said Hell is like:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in
                torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom." (<b>Luke 16:23</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">This verse is found in a story that Jesus was telling. It was a story of a rich
                man, and a beggar named Lazarus. In this story, both of these two men—the rich
                man and Lazarus—die.
                Lazarus is taken to be with Abraham (maybe you've heard of
                Abraham before) while the rich man is taken to Hell. Jesus says that this
                rich man "lift up his eyes, being in torments".</p>
            <p class="text-md">People often joke about Hell. They say things like, "In Hell, we'll have a
                never-ending party!" However, this could not be further from the truth. I
                believe that if
                the rich man Jesus told us about could come back to Earth for even 10 seconds,
                he would beg you to get
                saved so you didn't have to go to Hell. He was in torments,
                possibly thinking back to when he was on Earth and he didn't believe. Maybe he
                was even thinking about the times Lazarus had told him. Later on in the passage
                we see this verse:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have
                mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water,
                and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame." (<b>Luke 16:24</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">Again, we see another aspect about Hell. There is a flame, an unquenchable flame.
                A flame that will burn forever and ever. There is no water to give any relief
                from the pains of Hell. I know what it's like to go most of the day without
                water, but imagine knowing that you will <b>never</b> get any water, but having
                a great thirst for it.</p>
            <p class="text-md">When we die, there are two possible places for us to go. There is Hell, and there
                is Heaven. The Bible says that those who die without Jesus will go to Hell, and
                later to a place called the Lake of Fire—the second death:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and
                the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters,
                and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and
                brimstone: which is the second death." (<b>Revelation 21:8</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">Let me ask you, which place do you want to go? If your answer is Heaven, in these
                next sections, I will tell you how to go there!</p>
        </section>

        <!-- What can keep me from Hell?! -->
        <section class="xl:mx-96 lg:mx-52 md:mx-10 mb-6 flex flex-col text-left justify-center gap-2">

            <br>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium my-2 uppercase text-[#89837c]">What can keep me from Hell?!</h2>
            <p class="text-md">The Bible teaches that those who are saved do not come under condemnation:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
                believeth
                on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from
                death unto life." (<b>John 5:24</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">Wow! No condemnation! Those who are saved are not condemned because they have
                Jesus' blood applied to their sin debt. "Jesus' blood?" I hear you asking. Yes!
                Jesus' blood. What is the importance of His blood? Let's look at a verse:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"...and without shedding of blood is no
                remission." (<b>Hebrews 9:22</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">The remission (purging) of sins comes through blood. But not just any blood. You
                cannot go cut yourself until you start bleeding in order to pay for your
                sins. It has to be the perfect blood
                of a sinless man, the man Christ Jesus. It is only through His blood that we can
                find redemption!</p>
            <p class="text-md">When you have Jesus' blood applied to your account, God will no longer see your
                sins on judgement day. Instead, He will see the blood of Jesus!
                Would you like to know why it has to be Jesus' blood?</p>

        <!-- Why do I need Jesus' blood applied? -->
        <section class="xl:mx-96 lg:mx-52 md:mx-10 mb-6 flex flex-col text-left justify-center gap-2">

            <br>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium my-2 uppercase text-[#89837c]">Why do I need Jesus' blood applied?</h2>
            <p class="text-md">Well, first, let's look at Jesus Christ. He was God in the flesh:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"And without controversy great is the
                mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh..." (<b>1 Timothy 3:16</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">Yes, you heared that right. <b>God</b> came down to Earth. Jesus was born of a
                virgin and lived a sinless life. He never sinned, not even once! Now, what is so
                significant about Jesus living a sinless life? Well, a sinful person cannot pay
                for someone else's sins because they themselves need someone to pay for theirs!
                But since Jesus never sinned, He was able to be a sacrifice for all mankind:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"For God so loved the world, that he gave his
                only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
                everlasting life." (<b>John 3:16</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">God the Father sent His Son, Jesus, to Earth. Why would He do that? He did it
                because
                of His love for us. God loves people so much that despite Him knowing many
                would reject
                Him, He sent His Son anyway. He didn't just send His Son for no reason, He sent
                His Son for a purpose. That purpose was for Him to die on the Cross. That is why
                Jesus
                came. He lived, died, and rose again so that we could have redemption through
                Him.</p>
            <p class="text-md">Jesus did that just so that we might have a way to have our sins forgiven. Wow!
                What love! As we saw in the pervious section:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"...and without shedding of blood is no
                remission." (<b>Hebrews 9:22</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">Remission of sin only comes through the blood of Christ, which He shed on the
                Cross at Calvary. In the next section, we will finally discuss how you can
                actually have this blood applied to you, so that you might receive the gift of
                salvation.</p>

        <!-- How do I receive salvation? -->
        <section class="xl:mx-96 lg:mx-52 md:mx-10 mb-6 flex flex-col text-left justify-center gap-2">
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium my-2 uppercase text-[#89837c]">How do I receive salvation?</h2>
            <p class="text-md">First, we need to realize that the Bible tells us that salvation is a gift. Let's
                look at the end of a verse we referenced earlier:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"...but the gift of God <i>is</i> eternal
                life through Jesus Christ our Lord." (<b>Romans 6:23</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">A gift, wow! What exactly is a gift? Well, a gift is "something voluntarily
                transferred by one person to another without compensation" (Merriam Webster
                Dictionary). You see, we cannot do enough good to deserve salvation, yet Jesus
                offers it freely. There is no amount of money you can give to gain
                salvation—Jesus had to pay the price.</p>
            <p class="text-md">The question is, will you accept that gift? There are only two options: to either
                accept that gift, or to reject it. I hope you want to accept this free gift.
                So, how <i>do</i> you receive it? Well, in the Bible it says:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"<b>[8]</b> For by grace are ye saved
                through faith; and that not of yourselves: <i>it is</i> the gift of God:
                <b>[9]</b> Not of works, lest any man should boast." (<b>Ephesians 2:8-9</b>)
            </p>
            <p class="text-md">By simply placing your faith in Jesus Christ, you accept Him as your Lord and
                Saviour and He will apply His blood to your account. Some of my favorite verses
                in the Bible deal with this:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"<b>[30]</b> And [the jailer] brought them
                out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? <b>[31]</b> And they [Paul and
                Silas] said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy
                house." (<b>Acts 16:30-31</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">You must accept the Gospel (good news): That Christ died for your sins, was buried, and
                that He rose from
                the dead three days later. By trusting in His shed blood, you receive salvation.</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"[3] For I delivered unto you first of all that which
                I also
                received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; [4] And that he was buried, and
                that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:" (<b>1 Corinthians 15:3-4</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"Whom God hath set forth <i>to be</i> a propitiation through
                faith in
                his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance
                of God;" (<b>Romans 3:25</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">Nothing is required on your part besides just accepting the gift that is offered—a gift
                not a single
                person deserves. Will you accept the Lord Jesus today? Don't
                wait until tomorrow, don't wait until next week, get it settled right now.</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"...behold, now <i>is</i> the accepted
                time; behold, now <i>is</i> the day of salvation.)" (<b>2 Corinthians 6:2</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">Please, friend, don't let another day go by before you trust in Jesus as your
                personal Lord and Saviour.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium my-2 uppercase text-[#89837c]">After you are saved</h2>
            <p class="text-md">If you have accepted Jesus as Lord today, congratulations! You are now saved, and
                are a child of God. I would like to just tell you a few things before I end. Now
                that you are saved, you need to realize that no matter what you do, you cannot
                ever lose your salvation:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"<b>[28]</b> And I give unto them eternal
                life; and they
                shall never perish, neither shall any <i>man</i> pluck them out of my hand.
                <b>[29]</b> My Father, which gave <i>them</i> me, is greater than all; and no
                <i>man</i> is able to pluck <i>them</i> out of my Father's hand." (<b>John 10:28-29</b>)
            </p>
            <p class="text-md">You see, when we get saved, we are placed in the hands of God Himself. No man,
                including ourselves, can remove us from there. We are kept saved by God. Let me
                show you another verse:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"<b>[38]</b> For I am persuaded, that
                neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things
                present, nor things to come, <b>[39]</b> Nor height, nor depth, nor any other
                creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
                Jesus our Lord." (<b>Romans 8:38-39</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">Friend (and fellow brother- or sister-in-Christ), nothing in this world and
                nothing in Heaven can take our salvation away. We are sealed in Christ Jesus:
            </p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"And grieve not the holy Spirit of God,
                whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption." (<b>Ephesians 4:30</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">Now, you may ask, who is the "Holy Spirit of God?" Well, I haven't got room on
                this page to explain everything, but basically, God is one <i>being</i> but
                three
                <i>persons</i>. Those persons are: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God
                the
                Holy Spirit (also called the Holy Ghost). When you get saved, the third person
                of the Godhead, the Holy Spirit, begins to dwell within you and He will
                never leave you nor forsake you.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold">What are your next steps as a new Christian?</h4>
            <p class="text-md">You should start by finding a good, Independent Fundamental Baptist church near you.
                Once you find a church, you should attend it on Sundays and on
                Wednesdays/Thursdays (whenever that church has its midweek service). We are told
                to be in church in the Scriptures:</p>
            <p class="text-md pl-8">"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves
                together, as the manner of some <i>is;</i> but exhorting <i>one another:</i> and
                so much the more, as ye see the day approaching." (<b>Hebrews 10:25</b>)</p>
            <p class="text-md">Once you find a church, you should talk to the pastor about getting baptized.
                Baptism is the first step of obedience in the Christian walk.</p>
            <p class="text-md">Lastly, you should get yourself a King James Bible, and read it.</p>
